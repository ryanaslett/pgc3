		<title lang="en">Peoplesign CAPTCHA Plugin</title>
		<description lang="en">This is a unique picture based CAPTCHA.  Board owners can easily customize thier CAPTCHA to match the style of thier own site.  Visitors are presented with an easy picture-based test for them to pass, but automated bots are turned away.  It uses the secure peoplesign servers for rendering and validating tests, so the pictures and logic are hosted elsewhere.  The service is actively maintained, and additional features are planned.</description>
		<author-notes lang="en">After installing, use the Administration Control Panel to enable and configure this CAPTCHA.  No Database modification is neccessary.  A private key is required, and needs to be requested, so that it can be automatically emailed to you (see the DIY instructions).  Themes must support phpBB version 3.0.6 or later, or the CAPTCHA will not display. This is due to improvements in phpBB version 3.0.6 - See DIY instructions below for steps to enable this CAPTCHA for your theme..</author-notes>

		<diy-instructions lang="en">
   1. Obtain a key.
       + Visit peoplesign.com to have your peoplesign private key emailed to you, and optionally choose a Challenge Option String customization to control how the captcha displays on your site.
   2. Style.
       + Is your style based on prosilver or subsilver2?  This will help determine which tempplate file to use in the next step.  If you are unsure, choose prosilver.  If the peoplesign CAPTCHA displays in the wrong location on your page, then you should use the subsilver2 template file in the next step.
       + Copy either the file root/styles/prosilver/template/captcha_peoplesign.html OR the file root/styles/subsilver2/template/captcha_peoplesign.html into root/styles/MyTheme/template/ (replacing the name of your theme for "MyTheme" in the example given).
     Note that your theme must be built for phpBB3 version 3.0.6 or later (due to captcha improvements in 3.0.6)
   3. Configure.
       + Visit your Administration Control Panel and select "CAPTCHA module settings" [in phpBB 3.0.8 this is 'Spambot countermeasures']-> "Available plugins" -> "peoplesign:)" -> "Configure"  (peoplesign will be greyed out until you configure your private key on the next page)
	   + Paste your peoplesign private key (obtained in step 1.) into the box labeled "Peoplesign Key".
       + (optional) If you want to change the way the CAPTCHA renders on your site, Visit www.peoplesign.com/main/customize.html for a 'Challenge Option String' and paste it into the box labeled "Peoplesign Option String"
       + Click Submit to save your settings, and return to the main CAPTCHA module settings page.
   4. Activate.
       + Now you are ready to select "Available plugins" -> "peoplesign:)" and if you are satisfied with the preview that is rendered below, select "submit" to enable peoplesign on your site with the selected settins.
