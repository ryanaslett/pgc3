This SEO-Friendly plugin enables websites to 'go dark' on January 18th with a customizable message and start/end times to protest SOPA/PIPA and Internet Censorship

== Description ==

This plugin enables websites to 'go dark' on January 18th with a customizable message and start/end times to protest SOPA/PIPA and Internet Censorship

It enables you to customize the message displayed on the front end, and optionally display either a stylized 'Censored' sign or seal.

When 'dark' your website will return a `503 Service Temporarily Unavailable` status code so as to not damage your search engine rankings, as well as specify the length of time for the visitor to try back after.
