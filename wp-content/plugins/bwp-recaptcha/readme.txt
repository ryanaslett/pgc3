This plugin utilizes reCAPTCHA (with support for Akismet) to help your blog stay clear of spams.

== Description ==

In the 21th century, spamming could be one of the most annoying problems for a website. Especially if you use some publishing platforms like WordPress, your blog WILL be spammed and no default methods will save you from such nightmare. This plugin utilizes the popular anti-spam library, reCAPTCHA, to help your blog stay clear of spams (especially when you integrate it with Akismet). Unlike the current WP-reCAPTCHA plugin, this one has a different approach and allows you to customize how the captcha looks using CSS.

As of version 1.1.0, Contact Form 7 is supported out of the box.
